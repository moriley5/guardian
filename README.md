# Guardian

## Summary

Imagine an app that allows you to connect with and remember a lost loved one. An app that creates a space for you to consolidate all of your memories of that person, in the form of images, audio recordings, and notes. An app that serves as a personal and private outlet for your grief.

Guardian uses artificial intelligence and voice recognition to connect you with those who have passed on in a way that is more engaging, more responsive, and more realistic.

I pitched Guardian as my final capstone project for Dev Bootcamp. In the last eight days of the program, students work in small teams to build something new. I worked on a 4-person team, serving as the project lead, to build and design the app from scratch, which was presented to the faculties and students of Dev Bootcamp at graduation.

We consumed a third party API called API.AI to simulate conversation and generate interaction between users and their guardians. We also used Amazon Web Services to store the audio recordings and images and the Paperclip library to connect the files to our PostgreSQL database.

## Upcoming Features
